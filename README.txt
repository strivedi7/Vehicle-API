I have used Java and Spring Boot application using Maven. Web API is using H2 in memory database. I make all queries using JPA on H2. In which I have used dependency like H2, JPA, will be directly imported using maven. I have used IntelliJ IDEA editor.
Application will be running on http://localhost:8080/api/v1/vehicle with port number 8080.
